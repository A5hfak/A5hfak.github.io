# Excellent Presentation Certificate - ICRAE 2022

## Awarding Organization
7th International Conference on Robotics and Automation Engineering (ICRAE 2022)

## Presentation Details
- **Award**: Excellent Presentation Certificate
- **Event**: 7th International Conference on Robotics and Automation Engineering
- **Date**: November 2022
- **Topic**: Research on a low-cost indoor COVID-19 monitoring system
- **Paper URL**: [10.1109/ICRAE56463.2022.10056201](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAE56463.2022.10056201)

## Research Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted various aspects of our lives, reshaping activities such as healthcare, education, and business. Indoor safety monitoring is crucial to curbing the spread of COVID-19, and this paper presents a low-cost prototype system addressing this need. The system combines **mask detection**, **temperature measurement**, and a **social distancing alert** via a smart wearable band.

- **Mask and Temperature System**: The system uses an **Arduino Nano** connected to an **ESP32-Cam**. The camera captures images that are then analyzed by a **machine learning model** trained on thousands of images to detect whether masks are worn, achieving an accuracy of **98.7%**.
- **Temperature Measurement**: A **MLX90614 non-contact sensor** measures the temperature and displays it in real-time.
- **Social Distancing Alert Wearable**: A **NodeMCU 8266 Wi-Fi module** powers a wearable device that uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to detect other similar devices in close proximity. A buzzer and vibrator provide an alert if social distance rules are violated.

Our study presents a thorough analysis of the mask detection system's accuracy and temperature measurement, as well as the effectiveness of the social distancing alert in real-life scenarios.

## Presentation Highlights
Receiving this award recognized my ability to effectively communicate complex technical concepts and present practical solutions to address real-world issues. Key aspects of the presentation included:
- **Clear, Engaging Communication**: Simplified technical concepts for accessibility to a broad audience.
- **Technical Accuracy**: Delivered detailed answers to questions on hardware, software, and machine learning methods.
- **Innovative Impact**: Emphasized the potential real-world applications of the presented solution in indoor safety monitoring.
