    # Automatic Indoor Safety Control

        The **COVID-19 Safety Monitoring System** project was developed as an automated solution for enforcing key COVID-19 precautions: mask-wearing, temperature checks, and social distancing. This system leverages sensors, automation, and IoT for efficient monitoring and user guidance, with a clear focus on accuracy and safety in high-traffic environments such as institutions and public spaces.
        
        ### Overview and Working Principle
        
        Our system is designed to ensure safety compliance through an integrated series of checks:
        - **Temperature Check**: Uses the MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor to assess body temperature without physical contact.
        - **Mask Detection**: Utilizes an ESP32-CAM and machine learning model trained on mask and no-mask images to accurately detect mask usage.
        - **Social Distance Monitoring**: Through ESP8266 modules, this subsystem alerts individuals with a buzzer and LED if they come too close to one another indoors.

        Each module functions sequentially, with feedback provided to individuals on an LCD display. Upon successful checks, individuals can proceed, while any non-compliance leads to prompt instructions to ensure safety.
        
        ### Project Highlights

        - **Temperature Screening**: The MLX90614 sensor captures non-contact temperature readings and outputs results on an LCD via Arduino NANO. If temperature readings exceed 100°F, an alert instructs the individual to exit.
        - **Mask Detection**: A model trained on "Teachable Machine" detects mask usage via the ESP32-CAM. Distance is measured with an ultrasonic sensor to ensure optimal positioning, providing an accuracy percentage and final confirmation of mask compliance. Below is a sample camera view, showing AI detection with and without a mask:

          ![Mask Detection: No Mask (100%) & Mask (99.0%)](:p9_FaceDetection.jpg){:data-align="center"}

        - **Social Distancing**: Individuals are provided with an ESP8266-based device (a wearable) that continuously monitors distance via RSSI values. If proximity drops below 3.3 feet, the wearable device's buzzer and LED activate to signal the need to maintain distance.
        
        ### System Design

        The project involved designing both the hardware and software aspects of the system, including:
        - **Flowchart and Workflow**: A structured workflow and flowchart were developed to cover every scenario, as depicted in the **Workflow Diagram** below.
        - **Wearable Device**: Designed a 3D enclosure for the wearable social-distancing monitoring device, ensuring comfort and functionality. Below are renderings showing multiple views of the watch:
